This folder contains launch files for all the nodes.
The files can be used to launch all the nodes of the wizard chess command center

chess_position_controller.launch launches all three nodes of the command center from the robot_chess package
and the chess_controller.launch finds the first launch file, and runs it. To launch the command center use the 
chess_controller.launch file.
