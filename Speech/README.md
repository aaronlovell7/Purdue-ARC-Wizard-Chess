README

This is the folder that will be used to host all code used for speech recognition.

This code will take voice input from the player and output a string in the chess move format.

Format: Xy# ---- X = capital letter for piece to move; y = lowercase letter for column; # = number for row
        e.g. person says: "Bishop e four" --> 'Be4'
        will talk about specific outlier cases later (e.g. 'Pb8=Q')
